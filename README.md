The repository was created for recruitment purposes. This little application was written for my colleague to help him get data for analysis. Application was created in few hours in 18 of April 2017. I used my knowledge about web scraping and came to a solution in an area I don't have knowledge at all which is translations between geodetic coordinate systems. This solution and one discovery in the analysis of target web application behavior saved a lot of work and make whole code much simpler.

## Description
The purpose of this application is to scrape data from web application providing the [map of Gda≈Ñsk](http://mapa.gdansk.gda.pl/ipg/app/index). In Client.py file user specify in which types of locations is interested in. After that, the application is scraping the data, doing necessary transformations and saves it to the csv file.
